## Contextualizing
#### Objective
The purpose of this site is to present a traditional form of curriculum, introducing myself as a person to be hired by the company and to provide various services.

#### Initial idea
The initial idea was to create several .html files each being called by a link on the main page.<br>
In the beginning, it would be created in HTML language and simple CSS with small CSS animations for the menu.<br>
Fewer images would be used and the body of the file would be more textual.<br>
However, after taking a quick Bootstrap course, I decided to apply this tool by formatting the site with a more interactive, intuitive and modern look.

#### Layout
The layout was chosen so that it was easy to view and easy to navigate.

We can divide the site into 7 small parts:
menu
carousel
cover letter
CV
Card
experience as a volunteer
contact form

#### Colour
The colour chosen for this website was blue.
The reason for this choice is because of this colour is associated with depth and stability, loyalty, wisdom, confidence, intelligence, truth and heaven and is usually used to promote products and services related to cleanliness or to suggest precision when promoting high-tech products.

#### Comments
The code has a large amount of comment because it is an academic work and new tools were used to build this

#### Problems occurred and solutions
As Bootstrap is a new framework for me, at first it was a little difficult due to the amount of DIV that it includes in the code, sometimes causing me to close the tag in the wrong places generating a different layout than I had planned. however, with the insertion of comments for each section, the preconceived problems were solved.
<br><br>
Another problem that occurred was the reading of a created CSS file. As the CSS files were being used in Saas, therefore, SCSS, they were not being compiled causing a layout disruption.
To solve this problem, a style folder was created inside the main folder and inside the style folder, two others were created: CSS and SCSS respectively.
With the appropriate CSS files in these folders, it was possible to compile the CSS code via SaaS generating the chosen layout.
